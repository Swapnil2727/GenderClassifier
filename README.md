# GenderClassifier From Siraj Raval's Youtube Challange
This is Gender Classifier using Scikit-learn which comapre various classifiers and suggest the best one.

In this problem we have data regarding a personâ€™s height, weight, and shoe size. We will be making a classifier which predicts the gender of a new person, using this data. The classification should be done using multiple classifiers and the most accurate one should be identified.

So, the first thing to do after setting up Python and pip, is to install scikit-learn.

scikit-learn is a simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.

scikit-learn can be installed using the command

pip install scikit-learn

Now let us create our genderClassifier.py file.
